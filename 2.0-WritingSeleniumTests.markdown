# Writing Selenium RC Tests
Selenium tests should be placed under the `test/selenium` directory. As with other test types you can use packages to group your tests if you wish.

**Note:**
You should _not_ extend any of the base test classes in the Selenium API such as [SeleneseTestCase][1] or [GroovySeleneseTestCase][2] as these tests will attempt to create a separate Selenium instance (and open another browser window) for every single test! The plugin starts a Selenium instance for you when `grails test-app` runs the functional test phase. Your tests simply need to 
connect to that running Selenium instance.
