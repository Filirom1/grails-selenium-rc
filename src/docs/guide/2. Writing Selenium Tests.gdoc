Selenium tests should be placed under the @test/selenium@ directory. As with other test types you can use packages to group your tests if you wish.

{note}
You should _not_ extend any of the base test classes in the Selenium API such as
@[SeleneseTestCase|http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0-beta-2/doc/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/SeleneseTestCase.html]@
or @[GroovySeleneseTestCase|http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0-beta-2/doc/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/GroovySeleneseTestCase.html]@
as these tests will attempt to create a separate Selenium instance (and open another browser window) for every single
test! The plugin starts a Selenium instance for you when @grails test-app@ runs the functional test phase. Your tests
simply need to connect to that running Selenium instance.

There are several options available for writing Selenium tests:
 # [Using The SeleniumTest Mixin|guide:2.1 Using the SeleniumTest Mixin]
 # [Extending GrailsSeleniumTestCase|guide:2.2 Extending GrailsSeleniumTestCase]
 # [Using The Page Object Pattern|guide:2.3 The Page Object Pattern]

You are not limited to writing Selenium tests as JUnit test cases.
