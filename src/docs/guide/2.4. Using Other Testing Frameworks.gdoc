h2. Using Other Testing Frameworks
Selenium tests do not have to be written as JUnit test cases. Theoretically the @SeleniumTest@ mixin could be applied to
almost any test case written in another framework. Page objects are also agnostic of the test framework.

Currently the plugin has tested support for the
[Spock Plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/spock]. Other testing frameworks such as EasyB, TestNG, JUnit 4, etc. may well work already and support
is planned in future versions of the Selenium plugin.

To write Selenium tests using Spock, simply create your specification under @test/selenium@ and (if you are not using page objects) use the @SeleniumTest@ mixin then run tests as normal. For example:
{code}
import spock.lang.*
import grails.plugins.selenium.*

@Mixin(SeleniumTest)
class HomepageSpecification extends Specification {
    def "user can load application homepage"() {
        when:
            selenium.open(contextPath)
        then:
            selenium.isTextPresent("Welcome to Grails")
    }
}
{code}
