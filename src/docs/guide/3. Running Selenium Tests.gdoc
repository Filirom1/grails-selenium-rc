Selenium tests are placed in @test/selenium@ and are executed as part of the functional test phase with the standard 
@grails test-app@ or @grails test-app -functional@ commands. As with unit and integration tests you can run individual tests or
groups of tests by specifying the test names without the _"Tests"_ suffix. Again, like unit and integration tests
you can use @grails test-app -rerun@ to rerun failing tests.

The plugin will automatically start Selenium Server and Selenium instances at the start of the suite and close them
down cleanly at the end so your tests do not need to (and indeed should not) do so.
