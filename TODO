This version...
- remove GMock jar from plugin when built
- screenshot = "onfailure" doesn't capture screenshots when an assertion fails - only a selenium command
- override fail() in GrailsSeleneseTestCase to take screenshot
- can we get rid of SeleneseTestBase? Some calls don't delegate to it correctly
- Config override via system properties
- ensure not loaded in war / non test mode
- handle context path automatically
- correct packages

Long term...
- Selenium Grid
- Support non-JUnit frameworks e.g. EasyB, JBehave, Spock
