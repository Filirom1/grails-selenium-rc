Bugs...
- Using Assert.fail in mixin is not appropriate for non junit tests
- Can't use SeleniumTest.waitFor inside selenium.with block
- selenium.server.port & selenium.server.host do not work as sys property overrides

Enhancements...
- Support fixtures plugin via a controller and custom commands?
- Using selenium.with all the time is a bit annoying, can we delegate to 2 things at once?
- option to capture screenshots when assert/verify/waitFor fails
- can waitFor's message be defaulted based on the code in the closure?
- handle message argument on magic assert methods, e.g. assertText("o noes", "id=element", "expected")
- Run against running Selenium Server
- Run interactively against running app
- support for comparing text with message key to make i18n based testing less brittle

Long term...
- Upgrade to Selenium 2.0 / Webdriver
- Selenium Grid
- Support additional test frameworks e.g. JUnit 4, TestNG, EasyB, JBehave
