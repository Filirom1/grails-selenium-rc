This version...
- remove GMock jar from plugin when built
- captureScreenshotOnFailure = false doesn't capture screenshots when an assertion fails - only a selenium command
- can we get rid of SeleneseTestBase? Some calls don't delegate to it correctly
- delegate "command"-type calls from GrailsSeleneseTestCase to selenium - e.g. click, clickAndWait, open, etc.
- Config override via system properties
- ensure not loaded in war / non test mode
- handle context path automatically
- correct packages
- not sure if assertText(locator, expected), etc. should really have the args the other way round to be consistent with JUnit
- meta data to help with IDE auto completion

Long term...
- Selenium Grid
- Support non-JUnit frameworks e.g. EasyB, JBehave, Spock
