This version...
- remove GMock jar from plugin when built
- can we get rid of SeleneseTestBase? Some calls don't delegate to it correctly
- Config override via system properties
- ensure not loaded in war / non test mode (script test?)
- Make the selenium support a mixin to inject into any test case

Enhancements...
- option to capture screenshots when assert/verify/waitFor fails
- handle message argument on magic assert methods, e.g. assertText "o noes", "id=element", "expected"
- support for comparing text with message key to make i18n based testing less brittle

Long term...
- Just inject Selenium instance into any test declaring an appropriate property
- Selenium Grid
- Support non-JUnit frameworks e.g. EasyB, JBehave, Spock
