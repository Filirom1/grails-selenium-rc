- remove GMock jar from plugin when built
- tidy up use of config - some in SeleniumManager, some in GrailsSeleneseTestCase.setUp
- screenshot = "always" results in an error at the end of the test suite
- screenshot = "onfailure" doesn't capture screenshots when an assertion fails - only a selenium command
- separate config values for screenshot.always and screenshot.onfailure
- override fail() in GrailsSeleneseTestCase to take screenshot
- can we get rid of SeleneseTestBase? Some calls don't delegate to it correctly
- Config override via system properties
- Dynamic(?) assert* verify* & waitFor* methods
- ensure not loaded in war / non test mode
- handle context path automatically
- correct packages
