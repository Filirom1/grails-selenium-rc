This version...
- remove GMock jar from plugin when built
- can we get rid of SeleneseTestBase? Some calls don't delegate to it correctly
- ensure not loaded in war / non test mode (script test?)
- test can have spock and junit tests side by side
- Using Assert.fail in mixin is not appropriate for non junit tests

Enhancements...
- option to capture screenshots when assert/verify/waitFor fails
- can waitFor's message be defaulted based on the code in the closure?
- handle message argument on magic assert methods, e.g. assertText("o noes", "id=element", "expected")
- support for comparing text with message key to make i18n based testing less brittle

Long term...
- Selenium Grid
- Support non-JUnit frameworks e.g. EasyB, JBehave, Spock
